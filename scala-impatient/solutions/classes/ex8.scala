/**
* Exercise 8:
*
* Make a class Car with read-only properties for manufacturer, model name, and
* model year, and a read-write property for the license plate. Supply four
* constructors. All require the manufacturer and model name. Optionally, model
* year and license plate can also be specified in the constructor. If not, the
* model year is set to -1 and the license plate to the empty string. Which
* constructor are you choosing as the primary constructor? Why?

// > The constructor that takes 4 values was chosen as the primary constructor, thus becomes easier for auxiliary constructor to overload constructor on special conditions using `this()` by calling the primary constructor
