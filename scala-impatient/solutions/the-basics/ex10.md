10. What do the take, drop, takeRight, and dropRight string functions do? What advantage or disadvantage do they have over using substring?

> take - Selects first n elements, `def take(n:Int): String`


```scala
val s = "Hello"

s take 2    // res0: String = He
```
> drop- Selects all elements except first n ones, `def drop(n: Int): String`

```scala
val s = "Hello"

s drop 2   // res0: String = llo
```

> takeRight- Selects last n elements, `def takeRight(n: Int): String`

```scala
val s = "Hello"

s takeRight 2  // res0: String = lo

```

> dropRight - Selects all elements except last n ones, `def dropRight(n: Int): String`

```scala
val s = "Hello"

s drop 2   //res0: String = Hel
```

> Advantage
-  Allows you to treat String as a sequential collection of characters similar to Seq or List instance
-  More concise, intutive, error-prone-ness than substring
-  Such methods are not implemented in String itself but in StringOps class, an implicit conversion ensures that String converted into a StringOps whenever you need to access them.
-  Availability of implicit conversion means taking advantage of String "character sequence"-like nature to treat it like any other list situations when convinent

> Disadvantage
- Deciding which method to invoke for conversion
