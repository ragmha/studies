## Data structures

> The greatest room for variablity in algorithm design is generally in the way in which the data of the program are stored:

*   How they are arranged in relation to each other.
*   Which data are kept in memory.
*   Which are calculated when needed.
*   Which are kept in files, and how the files are arranged.
