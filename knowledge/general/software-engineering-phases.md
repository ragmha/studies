# Software Engineering ðŸ˜®

> `Software engineering` is the study and practice of methods helpful for the construction and maintenance of large software systems.


## Phases of life cycle :bicyclist:

1.  `Analyze` the problem precisely and completely. Be sure to `specify` all necessary user interface with care.

2.  `Build` a prototype and `experiment` with it until all specifications can be finalized.

3.  `Design` the algorithm, using the tools of data structures and of other algorithms whose function is already known.

4.  `Verify` that the algorithmm is correct, or make it so simple that its correctness is self-evident.

5.  `Analyze` the algorithm to determine its requirements and make sure that it meets the specifications.

6.  `Code` the algorithm into the appropriate programming language.

7.  `Test` and `evaluate` the program on carefully chosen test data.

8.  `Refine` and `repeat` the foregoing steps are neeeded for additional subprograms until the software is complete and fully functional.

9.  `Optimize` the code to improve performance, but only if necessary.

10. `Maintain` the program so that it will meet the changing needs of its users.
