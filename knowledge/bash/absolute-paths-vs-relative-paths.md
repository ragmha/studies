# Absolute paths VS Relative paths
> A path represents a location on the filesystem

## Absolute paths
*   Start with `/`
*   Relative to the root

```bash
/

/bin/bash
```

## Relative paths
*   Don't start with `/`
*   Resolved relative to current working directory

```bash
=========================================================
Path      ||     Working directory ||   Location
=========================================================
Library           ~                 /Users/raghib/Library
Course            ~/Document        /Users/raghib/Document/Course
```
