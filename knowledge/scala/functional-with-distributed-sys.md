# Functional Languages and Distributed Systems

*   First class Function
    > Functions can be passed to or returned from functions

*   Function composition
    > Chains of functions calling each other

*   Immutable data
    > Prevents inadvertently introduced side effects

*   Pure functions
    > No side effects; same output for same input

*   Ease of parallelism
    > Pure functions acting on immutable data
