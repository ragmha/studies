## Weekly Reflection 

What have you done? (materials etc. you have read, exercises and other experiments you have done, etc. )
* Read the Chapters (Operators & High-Order Functions)
* Did the book excercise, for Operators (1 to 8) and for High order function all the exercises

What have you learned?
* Infix operators
* Operator overloading
* Implicit conversions
* Apply and update
* Extractor using unapply for known elements and unApplySeq for unknown elements being applied
* Passing def as values must include "_"
* For anonymous function you can use () for . operator and { } when infix operator called
* Passing Functions as function parameters, for a single parameter we can use "_"
* Recursive functions requires 2 things: 1) Base case 2) Steps to reduce problem size and solve a smaller problem
* For Recursive function such as sum, we can use pattern matching and a cons operator for constructing our list
* Fold, fold-left, and fold-left are high order functions that operate on elements, has an accumulator defined
* Reduce, combines elements pairwise doesn't require an accumulator
* Currying, applying one param to n paramater function
* Currying helps with type inference a bit more exact

What topics have been hard for you?
* Shuffling with Fisher-Yates algorithm, not explained why it's needed and when
* Checking shuffle implementation "minmaxave" ??? no idea what it does
* Control structures not understood,in the notes.
* Difference between Cologne Cathedral and Grand Bazaar, not explained
* Example of Cafe bit hard to understand and wasn't able to find the example in the book would have to look for it again.Understood that the implementation of buyCoffee and buyCoffes are implemented and the SideEffects are handled in the outerlayer but didn't get a clear picture
* Referential transparency, where would it be used ?

What were interesting subject matters?
* Operators
* High Order functions
* Function composition
* Recursion
