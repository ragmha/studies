# Things to know (Async)ðŸ¤”

*   Single-threaded(bank with one teller)

*   Event Loop(line to use the bathroom)

*   Non-blocking(forgot papers, next person serviced)

*   Avoid blocking(don't hog the bathroom)

*   Run to completion(satisfy customer before next)

*   Cooperative Concurrency(customers play nice)

*   Little Programs(customers in line)

*   Think explicitly about Asynchronous Seams

*   Timer delay not guaranteed(calendar/todo list)

*   Not always async(quack, waddle but not a duck)

*   Race conditions in order of queue
