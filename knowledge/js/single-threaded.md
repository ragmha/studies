# Single Threaded

*   JavaScript has a concurrency model based on "event loop"

```
Example
In JavaScript Engine ...

JS engine can only execute one piece of code at a time. `Single Threaded`

* Bank with a single teller

* Bar with only one bathroom

```

*   The model is quite different than the model in other languges like C or Java(Multi-threaded)

```
Example: (Banks with several tellers)

Most Banks can serve customers(execute code) concurrently, like deposits and
withdrawals at the same time

```
