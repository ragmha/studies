# Do I need Redux ?

* Complex data flows

* Inter-component communications

* Non-heirarchical data

* Many actions

* Same data in multiple places

* Add redux if necessary

* Data being synced with a centralized single store (where components dispatches an action, the store connected to those component recieves the changes are renders)


-------------------------------------------

* Depends on data flow

* Handling state in a single spot 

* Suitable for complex app

* Significant setup

* Scalable foundation

* Rapid feedback experience
