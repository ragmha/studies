What is Rust?

- It's a moder systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection

Macro_rules

- Macros look like functions, except that their name ends with a bang !, but instead of generating a function call, macros are expanded into source code that gets compiled with the rest of the program. However, unlike macros in C and other languages, Rust macros are expanded into abstract syntax trees, rather than string preprocessing, so you don't get unexpected precedence bugs.
