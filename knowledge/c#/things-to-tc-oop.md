# Things to Take care while OOP

*   Avoiding branching instructions
    > Replace branching with objects

*   Avoiding loops
    > Build loops into sequential data structures

*   Turning data structures into objects
    > Encapsulate operations in the data structure itself

*   Turning algorithms into strategy objects
    > Replace strategies to modulate the algorithm

*   Treating some objects as simple values
    > => Treat them as you treat numbers.

    > =>  This simplifies code and reduces bugs :D

*   Avoiding null references
    > => Null is not an object

*   Avoiding multiway branching
    > => Model dynamic rules with objects

*   Separating infrastructure from domain logic
    > => Figuring which instructions are infrastructure, and which are the domain
