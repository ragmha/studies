# Basic Elements ðŸ˜Š

## Expressions

> In almost all programming languages you can create expressions such as:

```javascript
 (b*b-4*a*c)/2*a
```

> and you can assign these expressions to variables:

```javascript
 v = (b*b-4*a*c)/2*a
```

> In Haskell, you can do this as well, and whatâ€™s more: expressions are really all there is, there are no statements.

## Functions

> In Python, you can define a function such as

```python
 def hello(name):
     return "Hello, "+name
```
> In Haskell you can write this simply as:

```haskell
hello name = "Hello, "++name
```

## Types

> C has types, for example:

```c
int f (int x, int y) {
  return x*y+x+y;
}
```

> Haskell has much more powerful types than C

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y =  x*y+x+y
```
## Lists

> In many languages, e.g. Python, JavaScript, Ruby, â€¦ you can create lists such as:

```haskell
lst = [ "A", "list", "of", "strings"]
```

##### Haskell also uses this syntax for lists.


> To join lists, in Python you could write

```python
 lst = [1,2] + [3,4]
```

> In Haskell this would be very similar:

```haskell
 lst = [1,2] ++ [3,4]
```

## Anonymous functions
> In JavaScript you can define anonymous functions (functions without a name) such as:

```javascript
 var f = function(x,y){
   return x*y+x+y
 };
```

> In Haskell, such anonymous functions are called lambda functions and they are actually the basis of the language. Again, the syntax is very compact:

```haskell
 f = \x y -> x*y+x+y
```

## Higher-order functions
> Finally, in many languages, functions can operate on functions. For example, in Perl you can modify the elements in a list using:

```perl
  map sub ($x){$x*2+1}, [1..10]
```

> Haskell provides many of these so-called higher-order functions, and lets you define your own.

```haskell
    map (\x -> x*2+1) [1..10]
```
