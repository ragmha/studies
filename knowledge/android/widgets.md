# Widgets
> Widgets are the building blocks you use to compose a UI.

*   A widget can show text or graphics, interact with the user, or arrange other widgets on the screen.

*   Buttons, text input controls, and checkboxes are all types of widgets.

*   Android SDK includes many widgets that you can configure to get the apperance and behaviour you want.

*   Every widget is an instance of the View class or one of its subclasses(such as **TextView** or **Button**)
