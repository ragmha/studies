# How React Renders the View ðŸ¤”

```
                                    JSX Code is written
                                     describing a basic
                                        application

                                            |
                                            V

                                    JSX is converted into
                                      JavaScript by the
                                         Compiler

                                            |
                                            V

                                    React turns converted
                                    JSX into a virtual DOM

                                             |
                                             V

                                    Virtual DOM is applied
                                          to real DOM

                                              |
                                              V

                                     Underlying Data Model
                                           is updated

                                              |
                                              V

                                     React updates Virtual DOM
                                     and then quickly updates
                                          the real DOM
