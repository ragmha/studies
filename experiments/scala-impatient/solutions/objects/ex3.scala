/**
* Exercise 3:
*
* Define an Origin object that extends java.awt.Point. Why is this not actually
* a good idea? (Have a close look at the methods of the Point class.)
*
**/

object Origin extends java.awt.Point {}

println(Origin) //=> [x=0,y=0]

Origin.move(2, 2)

println(Origin) //=> [x=2,y=2]

// Because Point class has mutation method available called move
