/**
* Exercise 2:
*
* Write a program that reads words from a file. Use a mutable map to count how
* often each word appears. To read the words, simply use a java.util.Scanner:
*
  val in = new java.util.Scanner(new java.io.File("myfile.txt"))
  while (in.hasNext()) process in.next()
*
* Or look at Chapter 9 for a Scalaesque way.
* At the end, print out all words and their counts.
