/*

First copy the example source code below to the text box further down.
Example includes syntax errors. Press “answer” button. Carmatic checking and
feedback system tells you where and what kind of error the code contains. You
can also see what the Java-compiler says about the error. Find the errors in the
given code and fix them so that the source code does not contain syntax errors
and the program works according to the example print.

Program is written to a class called Introduction.


public class first

  public static void main (String [] args) {
    System.out.println("First contact with programming.")
  }
}

Example output:
First contact with Java-programming.
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace and is not
case-sensitive (the least strict comparison level)

public class Introduction {

  public static void main(String [] args) {
    System.out.println("First contact with programming.");
  }
