/*
First try at programming with C++ Example solution

The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs
with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it. In the
next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it
actually does.

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    int number;

    cout << "Input an integer:";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
  }
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number;

    cout << "Input an integer:";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;

    return 0;
}
