/*
Object interaction 2

In the exercise both the main program and the class "Calculator" have been
completed. Your task is to make up class "Printer" that asks the user for two
integers, calls for the class "Calculator" method "Sum()" transferring the
integers received as input to the method. Method "Sum()" calculates the sum
of the integers and returns the result. At the end method "Print()" prints
the given sum on screen. I.e. the code below doesnÂ’t need to be copied to the
answer field.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Calculator
{
public:
  int Sum(int first, int second);
};

int Calculator::Sum(int first, int second)
{
    int sum =first + second;
    return sum;
}

// your code
class Printer:public Calculator{
public:
   int num1,num2;
   void Print();
};

void Printer::Print(){
    cout << "Give a first integer: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Give a second integer: ";
    cin >> num2;
    cout << "Sum: " << Sum(num1,num2) << endl;
}

int main()
{
  Printer object;

  object.Print();

  return 0;
